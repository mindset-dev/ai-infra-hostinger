# 🚀 Roadmap — Evolving the Cognitive Infrastructure

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the strategic direction for the **mindset-dev / ai-infra-hostinger** meta-repository.  
It maps near-term development goals and long-term visions for cognitive infrastructure evolution.

---

## 🧭 Phase 1 — Foundation (✅ Completed)

| Focus | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Identity & Branding** | Established *mindset-dev* as your AI Systems Lab identity |
| **Documentation Framework** | Created `/docs` directory and structured narrative architecture |
| **Core Infrastructure** | Hostinger VPS + Docker Compose + Caddy + Cloudflare configured |
| **AI Stack Setup** | Flowise, Langfuse, Qdrant, Supabase, Neo4j, Ollama successfully orchestrated |
| **KIND Cluster** | Three-node Kubernetes cluster deployed for cognitive orchestration experiments |

---

## 🧩 Phase 2 — Expansion (🔄 In Progress)

| Objective | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Refactor local-ai-packaged** | Modularize into smaller, composable service definitions |
| **Integrate LangGraph** | Build multi-agent workflow orchestration for AI-native DevOps |
| **Launch AI Observability Dashboard** | Combine Grafana + Langfuse to visualize cognition metrics |
| **Container Telemetry Pipelines** | Export agent logs and traces into Neo4j + Qdrant embeddings |
| **n8n Cognitive Workflows** | Automate decision flows between Supabase, Flowise, and Neo4j |
| **Public Documentation Portal** | Publish these docs as a GitHub Pages or MkDocs site |

---

## 🧠 Phase 3 — Cognitive Systems (🔜 Planned)

| Objective | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **FastMCP Integration** | Deploy micro-control-plane for self-managing agents |
| **LangGraph Control Plane** | Enable AI agents to deploy, monitor, and heal other agents |
| **Federated Multi-Agent Mesh** | Connect multiple servers (e.g., via Tailscale) for distributed cognition |
| **Self-Learning Infrastructure** | Feedback loops where automation learns from system telemetry |
| **Adaptive Network Topology** | AI-driven routing decisions using Cloudflare + Caddy APIs |

---

## 🔮 Phase 4 — Open Cognitive Cloud (🌍 Vision)

| Objective | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Public AI Systems Lab Portal** | Showcase your live experiments and research |
| **Autonomous DevOps** | GitOps pipelines controlled by cognitive agents |
| **Cognitive CI/CD** | Pipelines that reason about builds, not just execute them |
| **Agent-Monitored Health** | AI that introspects your own infrastructure performance |
| **Decentralized AI Mesh** | Multi-node, open-source cognitive cloud federation |

---

## 🧠 Meta: “Infrastructure as Cognition”

> *Infrastructure should not just automate — it should reason, adapt, and evolve.*

The **mindset-dev** ecosystem will continue to explore this paradigm shift —  
bridging classical DevOps automation with cognitive orchestration.

---

## 📈 Milestones Summary

| Milestone | Status | ETA |
|------------|--------|-----|
| `v1.0` Documentation Framework | ✅ Complete | — |
| `v1.1` AI Stack Docs | ✅ Complete | — |
| `v1.2` Kubernetes Integration | ✅ Complete | — |
| `v2.0` Cognitive Orchestration (LangGraph + FastMCP) | 🧠 In Progress | Q1 2026 |
| `v3.0` Multi-Agent Infrastructure Federation | 🧩 Planned | Q3 2026 |

---

## 🧩 Next Steps (Immediate Actions)

- [ ] Add `/scripts/update.sh` for automated repo updates  
- [ ] Add `/scripts/sync-diagrams.sh` to refresh Mermaid diagrams  
- [ ] Link all `.md` files in the main README index  
- [ ] Begin LangGraph integration tests within KIND cluster  
- [ ] Explore MkDocs for hosting on GitHub Pages

## 💬 Closing Thought

> “AI doesn’t just automate pipelines — it **evolves them**.”

This roadmap defines the next era of **DevOps × AI** — your infrastructure isn’t static; it’s **alive**, reflective, and continuously learning.
