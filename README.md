# ðŸ§  AI Infra on Hostinger â€” mindset-dev
*Where automation evolves into cognition.*

This repository is the **meta-layer** for the Hostinger-based AI Systems Lab.

- **Working deployments live here â†’** https://github.com/mindset-dev/local-ai-packaged
- **Kubernetes agent workflows (KIND)** â†’ https://github.com/journeyman33/dot-ai (upstream: https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai)
- **Agent frameworks** â†’ https://github.com/coleam00/ottomator-agents
- **Archon (Claude Code RAG server)** â†’ fork: https://github.com/journeyman33/Archon (upstream: https://github.com/coleam00/Archon)

> This repo explains the architecture, shows diagrams, and provides lightweight scripts and templates.  
> **It does not duplicate the running Docker Compose stacks.**

Routing: Endpoints are fronted by Caddy and Cloudflare on bigtorig.com.

Projects as Units: Each stack runs with a Compose project name (e.g., -p localai, -p maui, -p o3) so docker compose down only affects that group.

ðŸ§° This Repo Contains

/docs â€” Architecture notes (network, projects, upstream inspirations)

/scripts â€” Non-invasive helpers for documentation/housekeeping

.env.example â€” Common variables (no secrets)

What it does not contain: full Docker Compose or secrets. Those stay in local-ai-packaged.
